# Micro Reddit Project

I'll build a very junior version of [Reddit](https://https://www.reddit.com/) called micro-reddit.
In this project, I‚Äôll build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting. I won‚Äôt build a front end for it because I don‚Äôt need to‚Ä¶ I can use the Rails console to play around with models without the overhead of making HTTP requests and involving controllers or views.


Follow the steps through [PROJECT: BUILDING WITH ACTIVE RECORD](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record-ruby-on-rails)

## Built With

- Languages: Ruby
- Framework: RoR

## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://)

## Getting Started

- Plan out what data models you would need to allow users to be on the site (don‚Äôt worry about login/logout or securing the passwords right now), to submit links (‚Äúposts‚Äù), and to comment on links. Users do NOT need to be able to comment on comments‚Ä¶ each comment refers to a Post.
- Generate a new rails app from the command line.
- Generate the User model and fill out the migration to get the columns you want.
- Run the migration.

For details on syntax and available methods [Rails API Documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html)

### Run tests

- Playing with validations
- Playing with Associations
